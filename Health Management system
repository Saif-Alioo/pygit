''' Health Management System . I used simple files and some fundamental concepts of python to accomplish this program.
two types of output we get (log) and (retrieve)
3 clients - Ayush , Anurag , Prateek
def getdate():
    import datetime
    return datetime.datetime.now()

Total 6 files
write a function that when executed takes as input client name
One more function to retrieve exercise or food for any client'''
